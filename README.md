# 📸 BulkPix - Image Bulk Processing

---

## 1. Project Overview

**BulkPix** is a personal tool developed for managing and processing large collections of images captured with my DSLR camera. Designed with flexibility in mind, it provides a range of functionalities, including:

- 🖼️ **Thumbnail Creation**: Automatically generate thumbnails for large batches of images.
- 📏 **Image Resizing**: Resize images to various dimensions for different use cases.
- 🎨 **ASCII Art Generation**: Convert images into ASCII art for creative applications.

This project is an ongoing effort, with plans to expand its capabilities over time. Future enhancements will include additional processing features and a user interface to make it more user-friendly.

## 2. Repository Structure

- 📂 **'images'**: The directory where you import the images for processing.
- 📁 **'images_resized'**: Contains the processed images, including resized versions and thumbnails.
- 📁 **'ASCII'**: Contains the ASCII art outputs.

## 3. Files in the Main Directory

I intend to expand this section as I refine the project and add more functionalities, such as incorporating the scripts into a `main.py`.

- 🖼️ **'ImageASCII.py'**: ASCII art generation script.
- 📏 **'ImageResize.py'**: Image compressor and thumbnail generation script.
- 📄 **'README.md'**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## 4. Data Sources

BulkPix does not require external data sources, but relies on the images you import into the 'Images' directory for processing. The processed results are saved back into the 'Outputs' directory.

Feel free to expand the project by adding more features or improving the interface as your needs evolve! 🚀
